# Voter-Prediction-Model

For this project, I attempted to create a model to predict whether or not an individual will vote, and if so, who they will vote for, entirely based on generally available demographic information. 

The data I used comes from the [ANES (American National Election Study)](http://www.electionstudies.org/studypages/anes_timeseries_cdf/anes_timeseries_cdf.htm).
